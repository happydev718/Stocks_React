StocksFC is a sports entertainment platform where sports fans (“you,” or “User”) can earn rewards based on the performances of real sports athletes. StocksFC creates digital tokens built on the StocksFC blockchain that correlate to the performance of professional athletes. Tokens are initially released by StocksFC via IPO ("Initial Player Offering") and after this they can be bought and sold with other users on the platform. StocksFC allows you to use your sports knowledge to build your portfolio and earn passive rewards based on the players performance, just like you can earn dividends from owning stocks on the real stock market.
