<b>Everything you need to know </b>
<p></p>
These Rules are applicable to the platform made available to Users of the Service. It is very important that you read and understand these Trading Rules before using the platform.

<p></p>

<b>Overview</b>
<p></p>

StocksFC is a blockchain sports trading platfrom that works similarly to a  stock exchange allowing users (known as "Traders") to purchase tokens that represent the performance of real professional sports players. purchasing a token is the act of buying tokens of one or more players using Ethereum as a payment method. Trading refers to the activity of our users when they buy and sell these tokens. When you become the owner of a token, you own it, it will be connected to your unique StocksFC blockchain address until you decide to sell it. There are two common methods of making profit on StocksFC. The first is purchasing tokens and accumulating the Ethereum reward payouts when they perform well in real life games and the second it purchasing tokens for lower prices and selling them for higher prices.

​<p></p>

There is no algorithm, bots or liquidity providers regulating StocksFC market activity. StocksFC only acts as a broker and a facilitator between sellers and buyers. Once the tokens are purchased from StocksFC and held by traders the market is controlled solely by supply and demand. StocksFC does not apply any trading algorithms or other mechanisms to influence price changes or fluctuations.
<p></p>

<b>Tokens</b>

<p></p>

A token is the digital asset which represents a sports athletes statistical in game performances. They are unique and limited in number. When a new token is released, StocksFC will sell it on the IPO page to users for a set price. A maximum of 100k tokens will be sold and all remaining unsold tokens will be destroyed. The player/token will never be minted again meaning that after the IPO (Initial Player Offering) the tokens can only be obtained from another user on the transfer market exchange page.

​<p></p>

Tokens have no limited validity period. They will be valid forever, however the tokens will only be able to receive reward payouts if the sports athlete's performance they represent is active.
<p></p>
<b>Price</b>
<p></p>

The initial price of a token is set by StocksFC when it is sold on the IPO page, when the IPO has ended only supply and demand from users will control the prices. Good in game performances can drive a players price up as they win more reward payouts and bad performances could negatively impact the tokens price. <br></br>
A tokens price can also be affected by the total number of tokens that exist for a player, A lower number of total tokens means larger reward payouts if the player wins a reward.
<p></p>

<p></p>

<b>Ethereum</b>
<p></p>

Ethereum (ETH) is the name of the cryptocurrency that allows you to trade on the platform. StocksFC aims to make it possible for all sports fans to be able to invest in the players that they love, wherever they are. We have therefore chosen to offer ethereum as the native currency and platform payment method. Ethereum is the second most valuable crypto in the world and it is based on its reliable and performant Blockchain which guarantees stable transactions. ETH is available from all exchanges and it can be stored on a wide variety of wallets.
 <p></p>

<b>Initial Player Offering (IPO)</b>

<p></p>

We regularly introduce new sports players on to the StocksFC platform, which is referred to as an Initial Player Offering (IPO).

​
<p></p>
We will announce IPOs on StocksFC official Discord server, twitter and email, Traders will have the chance to obtain the new tokens for a limited time period. Once there are no more IPO tokens available or the IPO time period ends, the only way to obtain tokens is to buy from a trader who already has some, because new tokens will never me minted again. Once the IPO has ended the token/player will be available to trade with other users on the transfer market page.
<p></p>

<b>Buying IPO tokens</b>
<p></p>

New IPO tokens will be made available on the IPO page. The IPO gives you a guaranteed chance to purchase tokens directly from StocksFC. You can buy as many tokens during the IPO period as you wish, provided you have sufficient funds in your account. There is a limit of 500 tokens per transaction and each order is executed by the blockchain in concurrent order.

<b>Transfer Market Orders</b>

<p></p>
IF you want to buy tokens after the IPO period is over you will need to place a buy order on the transfer market page and buy them from another trader that is selling them.
If other users are selling them the amount and price will be listed on the order book, you can choose to purchase them for the specific price requested or place a bid for a lower price. If no users are selling the token, you can place a bid and users that hold the tokens will have the choice to fill your bid and execute the trade.
<p></p>
<p></p>
Funds will be deducted from your balance and held in escrow at the moment your order is placed, if your order isn't instantly filled you can cancel it and your funds will be returned.
<p></p>

<b>Order Matching</b>
<p></p>

A Buy order is matched when the tokens you want to get match with a Sell order placed by another trader who wants to sell those same tokens. A matched order means that the buyer from the buy order and the seller from the Sell order both obtain what they wanted. StocksFC then transfers the tokens to the buyer and transfers the ETH to the seller's account. Note that there may be multiple sellers for a single buyer or vice versa.

<p></p>
​
When less than the total number of tokens subject to a Bid are successfully matched, the Bid is partially matched. In such a case, the Bid will remain open for matching in respect of the remaining unmatched tokens subject to the Bid. 

​<p></p>

All matches are subject to the commission that StocksFC is entitled to deduct on each and every transaction.

<p></p>
<b>Duration of Bids</b>

<p></p>
There is no limit date to your Bids. Your Bids will be listed in the orderbook until they are matched with an Offer. You can see the status of your open Bids directly from the transfer market page. 

<p></p>
<b>Cancellation of Bids</b>
<p></p>

You may cancel your open Bids at any time directly from  the transfer market page in the 'Open Orders' section.

​<p></p>

StocksFC reserves the right to cancel any and all of your Bids at any time should you infringe our Terms and Conditions. We also reserve the right to cancel your Bids in the event of major technical issues.

​<p></p>

Your unmatched bids will be cancelled as soon as possible in the event that your account is suspended or closed.
<p></p>

<b>Selling Tokens</b>
<p></p>

Definition

<p></p>
Selling your tokens is just as easy as buying them. You can list them on the transfer market orderbook for a specific price and other users will have the chance to purchase them from you.
<p></p>

When you make a sell order your tokens will be deducted from your balance at the moment your Offer is placed and held in escrow until the order has been filled by another user or you cancel the transaction.

<p></p>
<b>Transactions history</b>

<p></p>
All transactions for a particular player are listed on the transfer market page in the 'Transaction History' section.
<p></p>

<b>Portfolio</b>
<p></p>
Your portfolio is a list of all the tokens that you hold and will show you other information such as the amount of rewards the tokens have created for you and your overall profit.

<p></p>
<b>Transfer Market Fees</b>
<p></p>

Fees are always displayed on the screen before you confirm a transaction. StocksFC takes a small fee from both the Ethereum and the tokens during a sale. The Ethereum is added to the reward pots and the the tokens are permanently destroyed which means a players total token supply will be lowered after each trade.
 <p></p>

<b>Commission on IPO sales </b>
<p></p>

All IPO sales funds are distributed between the StocksFC reward wallets and the development and marketing wallets.

 <p></p>


<b>How are reward funds generated and how are IPO Sales funds used?</b><br></br>
When a player is sold via an IPO the funds generated by sales are split using a smart contract and funds are sent to the following blockchain wallets:
<br></br>
Team Of the Week Wallet
<br></br>
Team of the Month Wallet
<br></br>
Team of the Season Wallet
<br></br>
Inplay Rewards wallet
<br></br>
Marketing Wallet
<br></br>
BuyBack Wallet
<br></br>
Development and Operations Wallet
<p></p>
<b>Wallet Purposes:</b>
<br></br>
Team of the week wallet
<br></br>
The wallet that contains funds used to pay team of the week rewards. The wallet balance is viewable on the Reward Wallets page.
<br></br>
Team of the month wallet
<br></br>
The wallet that contains funds used to pay team of the month rewards. The wallet balance is viewable on the Reward Wallets page.
<br></br>
Team of the season wallet
<br></br>
The wallet that contains funds used to pay team of the season rewards. The wallet balance is viewable on the Reward Wallets page.
<br></br>
Inplay Wallet
<br></br>
The wallet that contains funds used to pay team of the Inplay rewards. The wallet balance is viewable on the Reward Wallets page.
<br></br>
StocksFC Dev Wallet
<br></br>
The wallet that contains funds used for marketing the platform, development and staking.
<p></p>
<b>BuyBack Wallet</b>
<br></br>
The buyback wallet is used to create buy orders for the player on the exchange when an IPO has ended. 5% of the IPO sales will be used to create a price floor. For example, if 10,000 Cristiano Ronaldo shares sell for £0.10 this will generate a total of £1000. 5% of this (£50) will be used to place a buy order for the player on the exchange at 0.5p per share, creating a permanent price floor for the player, it’s impossible for the players value to drop below this price and all shares can be sold back for this price at any timet to StocksFC, even when the player retires or moves to an unsupported league.

<p></p>
<b>Staking</b><br></br>
As StocksFC grows some funds generated by the StocksFC Dev wallet will be used for staking. Yeilds from StocksFC's internal staking practices will also fund reward wallets. StocksFC will publish information about our staking practices and the positive impact to reward wallets as and when staking begins.

<p></p>
<b>Rewards</b><br></br>
Team of the week and Inplay rewards are paid every week on Tuesday<br></br>

Team of month rewards are paid on every first Tuesday of the month<br></br>

Team of the Season rewards are paid on the first Tuesday of July each year<p></p>
<b>
The following process is used when paying out team of the week, month and season rewards:<br></br>
</b>
1. A percentage of the reward pot is allocated. This is currently set to 20% for the beta test.<br></br>

2. The reward allocated reward pot is divided between the 11 players equally. <br></br>

3. The players reward pot is split between each of the players shares. <br></br>

4. The players share owners receive the reward for each share that they own. <br></br>

<br></br><b>
Example:
<br></br></b>
If the team of the week reward wallet contains £10000, 20% (£2000) will be payed out in total. The £2000 reward pot would be split as between the 11 players, each player would be allocated £181. Each players £181 is then split between each existing share of the player. For example, If Cristiano Ronaldo has 2000 shares, each share would be allocated a prize £0.09. If a user owned 1000 of Cristiano Ronaldo they would receive £90.00 (£0.09 x 1000).
<p></p><b>
Inplay rewards are calculated differently:</b>
<br></br>
1. A percentage of the inplay rewards pot is allocated for the pay out.
<br></br>
2. Each players goals, assists and key passes are added together and each player is assigned a total number. Eg. 1 Goal, 0 Assists and 2 key passes would be a total of 3.
<br></br>
3, all players totals are added together, this is the total number of goals, assists and key passes for all players.
<br></br>
4. The allocated rewards pot is split between the players, depending on their total number of goals, assists and key passes. Players with a higher total will earn more than players will lower totals.
<br></br>
5. The players individual reward is split evenly against all tokens for that specific player.
<br></br>
6. Token holders receive the designated pay out for each share that they hold in their portfolio.
